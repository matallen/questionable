# How to use the framework

Please see this [Read.ME](https://github.com/matallen/questionable/blob/master/example-app-bc/README.md) for how to use the framework 



## To Develop

### Create project & deploy Decision Manager
```
./create-app.sh <new project name>
```

One manual post-install step is that you will then need to login to Decision Manager UI and re-add the dynamic-questionnaire-model dependency to the project and "build & deploy" the project before trying the demo app.
